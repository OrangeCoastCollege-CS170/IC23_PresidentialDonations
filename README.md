# IC23_PresidentialDonations
Attached to this assignment are two text files containing all the contribution amounts (in whole dollars, no cents) for the 2016 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump presidential campaigns, contributed from the zipcode 926xx (zipcode of Costa Mesa and surrounding areas).  They have the file names: clinton2016donations.txt and trump2016dontations.txt respectively.  This is real data, publicly available from the Federal Election Commission (http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do).

Your task is to write a Java application that searches through the file and displays the largest contribution, the smallest contribution and the average of all contributions made to the 2016 presidential campaign from zipcode 926xx for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump

You can display this information in output to the console, once your code has finished processing the attached text files.
